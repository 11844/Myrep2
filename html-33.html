    <b>Keyboard</b><br><br><p>
     A keyboard is the main input device that lets you input data and execute commands given to the computer. It has
     some additional keys categorized into four main areas:<br><br>
     1. Typing keypad: It includes all character symbols (A-Z).<br>
     2. Numeric keypad: It includes number keys form 0 to 9.<br>
     3. Function keys: There are 12 keys which perform special tasks. They are from F1 to F12.<br>
     4. Editing keypad: It comprises of insert, delete, backspace, page up, page down keys, etc. <br><br><br><br>
   <a name="Scanning System">
    <b>SCANNING SYSTEMS</b><br><br>
    Scanning systems are the eyes of a computer that can read words, pictures, or numbers directly from the page and 
    convert them into a form which the computer can understand, and display them directly on the monitor. Scanner
    allows you to save a printed picture and text as a file on a PC.<br><br><br>
   <a name="OCR">
    <b>OCR</b><br><br>
    Optical Character Recognition: It is used to read characters from a printed paper into the computer.
    The shape of the character is recognized by OCR with the help of a light source in conjuction with the 
    photoelectric cells. When a page of text is scanned, it is converted into computer readable form and reproduced 
    just as though it has been typed. The software then places the text into a document that can be edited using 
    the word processor or text editor. <br><br><br><a name="OMR">
     <b>OMR</b><br><br>
     Optimal Mark Reader: It is an execellent device for checking the documents and multiple choice type questions.
     The candidates are required to put a standard dot in front of the correvt answer with a soft pencil. While evaluating the,
     answer sheets, OMR directs a thin beam of light on the surface of a paper. Lesser amount of light is transmitted 
     through the dots as compared to nearby surface due to which, the answer is recognized by the computer.<br>
     There are three basic kinds of scanners:<br>
     1. Flatbed Scanner: Much like a photocopy machine.<br>
     2. Sheet-fed Scanner: It is used in fax machines and uses mechanical rollers of paper over the scan head.<br>
     3. Handheld Scanner: It allows the user to move the scan head over the material to be scanned. It is useful for copying
     small images like signatures, small photographs, and logos etc.<br>
