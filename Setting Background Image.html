        <p align="left"><h1>GOD IS GREAT</h1>
        A tree is unaware of it's own extraordinary significance. A flower does not realize what a delicate and exquisite masterpiece it really is. A bird is oblivious to it's own breath taking beauty. Though all things in this world are classic specimens of the most equisite art, they never come to know themselves as such. For whom then, is this beautiful and gracious display? Is is all for man's benefit. Man is the only being in the known universe who can perceive beauty in a thing and appreciate it's excellence. God has created an equisite work of art in worldly form and enabled man to apprehend it. He has given man a tongue to express his wonder and veneration at God's stupendous feats of creation.</font></p>
