  Ice Stupa is a form of glacier grafting technique that creates artificial glaciers, used for storing winter water in the form of a conical shaped ice heap.
  Agriculture relies mainly on the water that comes from snow and glacial melt. Howerever, with rising temperatures and changing weather patterns, most villages in the area are experiencing severe water shortage.
  Sonam Wangchuck has been on a mission to help villagers to adapt to the changing climate through his ice stupa concept. The ice stupa builds upon a simple idea - by directing glacial melt or water travelling downstream through a pipe to location nearby. The water is then channelled veertically, freezing and forming cone-like structures in temperatures reaching minus 20 degrees Celsius.
