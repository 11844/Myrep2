Each individual web page, image and video is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator (URL), enabling browsers to retrive these resources from a web server and display them on the user's device.
   A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are always confused. For a user, a search engine is just a website, such as google.com, that stores searchable data about other websites. But to connectto a website's server and display it's web pages, a user needs to have a web browser installed on their device.
   The most popular web browsers are Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Edge.
